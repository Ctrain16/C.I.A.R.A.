# C.I.A.R.A.

Cal's Intelligent And Responsive Automaton is my custom discord bot that is built using Node.js (previously Python).

## Functionality

Ciara's functionality will expand over time. Currently she supports the following:

- Music
- Leveling system based on message count
- Welcome messages
- Giving new users a role

## Hosting

Currently I have the bot hosted locally on a raspberry pi.

## Discord.js

Discord.js is a Discord API wrapper I utilized.

The documentation can be found [here](https://discord.js.org/#/).
